Current implementation for hashmapping files and their sizes sizes doesn't allow for updating the hashmap when the file size changes.
Format the file explorer into columns, and give a length limit to the file name column.
File and Folder dialog open at same time and the x button on them doesnt work (remove the X button in favor of the close button)
