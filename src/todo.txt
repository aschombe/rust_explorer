Format the file explorer into columns, and give a length limit to the file name column.
File and Folder dialog open at same time 
File and Folder dialog x button doesnt work (remove the X button in favor of the close button)
Check if file or folder exists before creating it, and if it does, prompt the user to overwrite it.
