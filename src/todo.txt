<-- set sizes to 0 for now
File size calculation causes program hang when first launching and changing directories. 
Also some directory levels arent calculating their size properly. 
-->

<-- might not apply anymore - try to find better solution for finding file and directory sizes 
(fs::extra::dir::get_size()) (dir size)
(std::fs::metadata().len()) (file size)
Current implementation for hashmapping files and their sizes sizes doesn't allow for updating the hashmap when the file size changes.

Fix button sizing and spacing (just fix formatting in general for sizing). // especially for the operations panel
Format the file explorer into columns, and give a length limit to the file name column.
File and Folder dialog open at same time.
File and Folder dialog x button doesnt work (remove the X button in favor of the close button).
Check if file or folder exists before creating it, and if it does, prompt the user to overwrite it, don't instantly overwrite it.
Cancel button doesnt close delete dialog.
Make checkbox for showing hidden and system files bigger.
